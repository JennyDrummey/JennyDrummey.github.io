<h3 id="bug-fixes">Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Keep notes for bug fixes simple and limited to one sentence. If the way in which the issue was fixed is a change for the user, you can mention it in the note with â€œby.â€</p></li>
<li><p>Include the Jira ticket in brackets at the beginning of the release note.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For example: It might help the reader to know that the related asset name is now being truncated.</p>
<p>[KYB-1054] â€“ Fixed an issue where long asset names were causing a horizontal scroll bar for related assets on the asset detail page by truncating the name of the related asset.</p>
<p>The reader does not necessarily need to know that the misalignment was fixed by resizing a div container.</p>
<p>[KYB-1157] - Fixed an issue on the Add Fields tab of the Data Set detail page where the Add iconâ€™s plus sign was misaligned.</p>
