        <h2 id="graphics-in-online-documentation">Graphics in Online Documentation</h2>
        <p>Screen shots and graphics are used sparingly in online documentation. For localization, understand that text in graphs require translation and follow the same writing guidelines as text in other online documentation.</p>
        <p>Keep graphic source files so that it is possible to translate the text layers. Graphics software merges (flattens) text layers when you save a graphic for publishing (for example as .png or .jpg). You cannot edit or translate the text in a .png or jpg file. To keep the source text layers when using Snagit, for example, save graphics with text layers as the Snagit file format (.snag) before converting them to .png or .jpg formats.</p>
        <h2>Screen Shots</h2>
        <p>Screen shots and gifs are created using the data in the Customer Success Documentation Team tenant. Refer to the following guidelines when creating screenshots and gifs for Syniti documentation.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Screenshots have a 1-pixel black border.</li>
            <li>For callouts, arrows, etc. use the standard red color in the SnagIt editor.</li>
            <li>The width for arrows and call out shapes is 1 pixel.</li>
            <li>Try to keep screen shots narrowly focused and only show the feature or option you are illustrating and not an entire window. This can save content development time because you might have to update screen shots less frequently for changes to the UI that did not affect the specific feature or option you captured.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>GIFs</h2>
        <p>Refer to <a href="../DocProcess/UseGIFsInOnlineHelp.html">Use GIFs in Online Help</a> for more informaiton.</p>
        <p>Use sparingly. Do not use for CRUD (create, read, update, delete) functionality. A GIF showing a form being completed and a Save option being clicked is not necessary to understanding or engaging to a reader.</p>
        <p>Use a 400 pixel max width. Smaller gifs are fine as long as they are easy to see and fit in the frame or window for of the Help system.</p>
        <p>You can use LICECap to record gifs. Download LICECap here: http://www.cockos.com/licecap/</p>
        <p>You can use GIMP, an open-source image manipulation program, to record or edit GIF size. GIMP can do a lot of work Photoshop does. GIMP’s website: https://www.gimp.org/</p>
