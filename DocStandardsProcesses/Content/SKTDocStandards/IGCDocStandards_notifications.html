        <h2 id="notifications-and-messaging">SKT Notifications and Messaging</h2>
        <p>There are two types of notifications in SKT:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Email messages</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>In-app messages</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Write email and in-app messages in the active voice, with the subject of the sentence performing the action. There is one exception:</p>
        <p>“You have been assigned to [this asset] by [this person].”</p>
        <p>In the example above, we want the user to know immediately that something has happened that affects them personally. It helps draw attention to the message when it begins with “you.”</p>
        <p>This is the Google sheet where we track SKT messaging: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O2D3Rp2b5Ojr5nmse72nHuUJTt8l8SSCCHQh7BFkddk/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O2D3Rp2b5Ojr5nmse72nHuUJTt8l8SSCCHQh7BFkddk/edit?usp=sharing</a></p>
