        <h1>What's New Standards</h1>
        <h2>Enhancements and New Features</h2>
        <p>Include “Refer to” statement and a link to relevant use case in release notes announcing enhancements or new features.</p>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <p>Fields can now be deleted from a System. Fields that have been deleted from a System appear as Deprecated on the Fields tab of the Data Set detail page. A filter for Depreciated fields has been added to the Data Set detail page on the Fields Tab.</p>
        <p>Refer to <strong>Import fields to a System</strong> and <strong>Set up Data Sets</strong> for more information.</p>
        <h2>Bug Fixes</h2>
        <p>Keep notes for bug fixes simple and limited to one sentence. If the way in which the issue was fixed is a change for the user, you can mention it in the note with “by.”</p>
        <p>Include the Jira ticket in brackets at the beginning of the release note.</p>
        <p>For example: It might help the reader to know that the related asset name is now being truncated.</p>
        <p>[KYB-1054] – Fixed an issue where long asset names were causing a horizontal scroll bar for related assets on the asset detail page by truncating the name of the related asset.</p>
        <p>The reader does not necessarily need to know that the misalignment was fixed by resizing a div container.</p>
        <p>[KYB-1157] - Fixed an issue on the Add Fields tab of the Data Set detail page where the Add icon’s plus sign was misaligned.</p>
