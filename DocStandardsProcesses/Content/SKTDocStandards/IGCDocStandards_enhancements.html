        <h1>SKP What's New Standards</h1>
        <p>Types of release notes should be ordered as follows:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p><a href="#New">New Features</a>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><a href="#New">Enhancements</a>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><a href="#Bug">Bug Fixes</a>
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h2><a name="New"></a>New Features and Enhancements</h2>
        <p>Include “Refer to” statement and a link to relevant use case in release notes announcing enhancements or new features.</p>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <p>Fields can now be deleted from a System. Fields that have been deleted from a System appear as Deprecated on the Fields tab of the Data Set detail page. A filter for Depreciated fields has been added to the Data Set detail page on the Fields Tab.</p>
        <p>Refer to <strong>Import fields to a System</strong> and <strong>Set up Data Sets</strong> for more information.</p>
        <p>To show that the enhancement was made for our users, to make their lives easier:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Explain how the enhancement will make working in the SKP easier and/or better for the user.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Make the release note in active voice to make it a little more exciting, and it gives us the opportunity to name ourselves (we, at Syniti) as the hero of this tiny little release story.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If providing steps to finish a task, use this imperative structure: "To do this thing, complete this step." For example, "To copy the Tenant ID to your clipboard, click the Tenant name."</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h2><a name="Bug"></a>Bug Fixes</h2>
        <p>Keep notes for bug fixes simple and limited to one sentence. If the way in which the issue was fixed is a change for the user, you can mention it in the note with “by.”</p>
        <p>Include the Jira ticket in brackets at the beginning of the release note.</p>
        <p>The date you use for a bug fix release note should be the day that the Jira ticket status was moved from Dev -&gt; Prod. When a ticket is moved to Prod in Jira, it means that the code is live in production. For one-off bug fixes that are not part of a feature release, this is most often the date on which the bug fix will be visible to users.</p>
        <p>For example: It might help the reader to know that the related asset name is now being truncated.</p>
        <p>[KYB-1054] – Fixed an issue where long asset names were causing a horizontal scroll bar for related assets on the asset detail page by truncating the name of the related asset.</p>
        <p>The reader does not necessarily need to know that the misalignment was fixed by resizing a div container.</p>
        <p>[KYB-1157] - Fixed an issue on the Add Fields tab of the Data Set detail page where the Add icon’s plus sign was misaligned.</p>
