        <h2>Manuals to Update for each SST GA Release</h2>

        <p>NOTE: The most recent PQ did not require us to produce these manuals. We may have to do so n the future. Formerly the Cloud SKU, this item has passed the PQ Process and is on the price list as of November 2019. Cloud edition users will always be new installs, and on prem users will not update to cloud. We do not need to provide the security migration documents prepared for the 7.1 release for this product.</p>

        <h3 id="sources-of-content">Sources of Content</h3>
        <p>Changes to the Installation Manuals are tracked in Jira. Sources of changes include:  </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Jira tickets </p>

        <h3 id="organization-of-the-installmanuals-flare-project">Organization of the InstallManuals Flare Project</h3>
        <p>The project is organized by manual. Several sections are used across multiple manuals, with conditional tags applied. </p>
        <p>The Version History topic (Appendix A for the Installation Manual and the SRHS Guide) is updated for each manual with all updates made to the manual in the release. Appendix A is not delivered with the final system, it is used so that the documentation team can track changes for each version. The most recent entry is at the top.</p>
        <h3 id="update-the-installation-manuals">Update the Installation Manuals</h3>
        <p>The following steps describe the collaboration, review, approval and final formatting process to get the Installation Manuals ready to publish for each software release.</p>
        <p>Members of the Documentation Team take turns updating the Manuals for each release.</p>
        <p>Follow these steps to update the install manuals: </p>
        <p>1. <a href="#Synchronize_your_master_branch_with_the_BackOfficeAssoc_GitHub_Repo">The Tech Writer synchronizes their local master branch with the BackOfficeAssoc dsp-install-manuals master branch</a>. NOTE: If you do not have a local copy of the install manuals on your laptop, see <a href="#Clone_the_dsp-install-manuals_repo">Clone the dsp-install-manuals repo</a>.</p>
        <p>2. <a href="#Create_a_branch_for_your_updates_based_on_the_master_branch">The TW creates a new Staging branch based on the Master branch in the dsp-install-manuals repo</a>. </p>
        <p>3. <a href="#Create_a_Release_Folder_on_SharePoint">The TW creates a release folder on SharePoint in the Published folder for the current release, creates new Word docs for review with the updated version number in the file titles</a>. NOTE: Ensure Track Changes is turned on for this version so that reviewers can find updates easily. The TW will include a link to this folder in the next step when they create the Jira ticket.</p>
        <p>4. <a href="#Create_a_JIRA_Ticket_for_the_Manuals">The TW creates a Jira ticket in the DSP70 project for updating the manuals for this release</a>. </p>
        <p>5. <a href="#nk_Tickets_Related_to_Manuals_to_JIRA_Epic">The TW links all tickets that describe updates to manuals to this ticket to track the updates</a>. </p>
        <p>6. The TW and contributors review and update the manuals in Sharepoint in the Published folder and Flare as needed. If major changes have been made to the Installation Manuals, Support will test these steps. </p>
        <p>7. Once the collaboration is complete and the content is final, the approver sets the <strong>Documentation Status</strong> field to of the installation manual Jira issue to <strong>Approved</strong>. </p>
        <p>8. The TW makes the changes in the Stangingnnn branch of the Flare project. Refer to <a href="BOADocProcess_UpdateOnlineHelp.html">Update Online Help</a> for more information. After all changes are made, the TW builds the project in the dev environment in Jenkins.</p>
        <p>9. The TW sets the <strong>Documentation Status</strong> field of the installation manual Jira issue to <strong>Peer Review</strong> and requests a peer review from another tech writer on the team in the doc_checkouts Slack channel. </p>
        <p> 10. After peer review is complete, if needed,the Author updates the Falre project and builds the install manuals Flare project in dev/prod. </p>
        <p> 11.  The TW sends notification that the final manuals are ready to Support with a link to the production version  and then closes the Jira ticket. </p>
        <p>IMPORTANT: The master branch must be updated with the latest changes at the close of each release, and a new Staging branch must be created at the beginning of every release cycle from the master branch by the Tech Writer who is handling the manuals that release cycle. Sometimes customers need manuals specific to the version of SST that they are running, so the Staging branches must not be updated or deleted once they have been merged into the master branch.</p>
