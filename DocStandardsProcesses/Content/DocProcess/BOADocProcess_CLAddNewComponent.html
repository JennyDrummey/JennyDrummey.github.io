        <p>Each component with page descriptions should have the first menu item in the use case TOC as Component name Page Descriptions. This links to a page with a hyperlinked list of all pages in the compoonent. An alphabetical navigation bar displays at the top. This bar is controlled by javascript, and the scripts have been added to the resources/scripts folder. The scripts were downloaded and slightly modified to suit our needs.
