        <h1>Unifying Support KB Articles and Online Help</h1>
        <p>As we have the time, it would helpful to sync the information that we have in the Knowledge Base articles that we have been writing for the support team and the existing documentation in the Online Help.</p>

        <ol type="1">
            <li>
                <p>Identify <em>Overview</em> Knowledge Base articles that cover broad issues within the products. </p>
                <p>NOTE: Smaller articles that cover extremely specific support issues will probably not have a large impact on the Online Help and can be (mostly) disregarded.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Check the “Refer to…” topic suggestions mentioned in the article.</p>

            <li>
                <p>Search the Online Help for topics that may pertain to the issues covered within an <em>Overview</em> article.</p>

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If you find a discrepancy, create the appropriate Jira issue on the DocTeamToDos board.</p>
