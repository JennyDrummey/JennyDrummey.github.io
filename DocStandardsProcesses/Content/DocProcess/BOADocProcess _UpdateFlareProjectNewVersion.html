        <h1>Update Flare Project for a New SST Version</h1>
        <p>After a version of the SST has been released, the doc team creates a new branch for the SST help based on the finalized branch of the current help. This new version becomes the help project that is now “in development.”</p>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>
                <p>Right-click your local repo folder (dsp-docs) and select Git Bash Here from the dropdown menu to open the command prompt at that location.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Enter the git command <span style="font-family: Consolas;">git checkout develop_nnn</span>, where <span style="font-family: Consolas;">nnn</span> is the version number of the finalized help (as in, the help that was just released).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Enter the git command <span style="font-family: Consolas;">git pull origin develop_nnn</span>, where <span style="font-family: Consolas;">nnn</span> is the version number of the finalized help.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Enter the git command <span style="font-family: Consolas;">git checkout -b develop_NEWDSPVERSIONNUMBER</span>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Open Flare and add a “What’s New in [New Version Number]” topic.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Update the two What’s New links in the TopNav TOC to point to this new topic, and update the version number in the TOC.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Copy the content from the What's New topic of the last finalized version of help to the top of the topic "Changes in Previous Versions". Add bookmarks to the headings as needed. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Update the Version Variable in the Variable window and on the Variables tab in the target.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Update the sitemap URL with the new version (https://dsphelp.syniti.com/xxx/*) on the Search tab in the target.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Save and close Flare.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Return to git bash.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Stage your updates for commit by entering the command <span style="font-family: Consolas;">git add .</span></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Commit staged updates by entering the command <span style="font-family: Consolas;">git commit -m “commit message”</span></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Push your updates to the remote repo by entering the command <span style="font-family: Consolas;">git push origin develop_NEWDSPVERSIONNUMBER</span>. You do not need to create a PR for this new branch name, as you are adding a new branch to the repo that we will all now be working in.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Build the help in jenkins in dev and prod. This allows the test team to confirm that links between the product version in development and the online help still work. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Post a message to the #doc_checkouts slack channel to let the other writers know that the new branch is available.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Locate the ticket in the Jira project that QE entered to track the testing of the online help, for example DSP70-921.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Mention a QE resource on the ticket, and copy the URL of the prod site into the comment.</p>
            </li>
