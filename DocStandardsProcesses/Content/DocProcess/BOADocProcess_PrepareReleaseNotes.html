        <h1>Prepare SST Release Notes</h1>
        <p>NOTE: The Syniti Solutions release notes are produced every time there is a release of the SST. The SAP Accelerators release notes are produced when the version of the SST will go through the SAP PQ process.</p>
        <p>The content of the What’s New topic in the help is prepared as a Word document and distributed as a secured PDF via the support site. It is stored in a Published folder, along with the Installation and Configuration manuals, for each released version of the SST.</p>
        <p>As the content in the release notes is based on the finalized content of the What’s New topic in the help, ensure the steps to review and prepare the content have been completed. Refer to <a href="BOADocProcess_PrepareWhatsNew.html">Prepare What’s New Topic for Release</a> for more information.</p>
