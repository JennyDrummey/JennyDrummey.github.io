        <h1>Prepare SST What's New Topic for Release</h1>
        <p>When all content is finalized for a release (as in PM has approved all content and it has been added to the Flare project by the Technical Writers and peer reviewed), a Technical Writer reviews the entire What’s New topic before the SST is released.</p>
        <p>NOTE: The SKT has a What's New topic that is not released in a pdf version, and is updated according to deployments in the cloud. </p>
        <p>The What’s New topic is often the first one the user sees and must be free of grammar issues, typos, and broken links. This help topic is used as the basis for the release notes, a secured PDF that is also distributed with each SST release. Refer to <a href="BOADocProcess_PrepareReleaseNotes.html">Prepare Release Notes</a> for more information.</p>
        <p>The single, version-specific What’s New topic is formatted with condition tags in Flare. Two versions of the What’s New topic are created from this topic: one for the Syniti Solutions version of the help and one for the SAP Accelerators version.</p>
        <h2 id="update-release-date">Update Release Date</h2>
        <p>The official release date is listed at the top of the What’s New topic. Update this with the release date, which also matches the release date in the Version History of the installation manuals.</p>
        <h2 id="review-structure-of-release-notes">Review Structure of Release Notes</h2>
        <p>Content is organized into these sections.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>New Features</li>
            <li>Enhancements</li>
            <li>Resolved Issues</li>
            <li>Known Issues</li>
            <li>Enhancement Requests from Users</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These headings display as links at the start of the What’s New topic. Not every release will have content in each of these sections. Remove (or add, as needed) these links at the start of the What’s New topic, depending on that version’s contents.</p>
        <p>Each section (New Features, Enhancements, etc.) is divided into subsections based on product name and component. Review the headings and structure in the What’s New topic, confirming that condition tags are applied correctly as noted in the next sections.</p>
