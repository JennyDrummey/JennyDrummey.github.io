            <h1>MadCap Flare Licensing and Upgrade Process</h1>
            <p class="note"><b>NOTE:</b> The Documentation Team uses Madcap Flare to generate the online Help for  Syniti products. Contact the Technical Writer Manager for the Flare license key to install or upgrade the software and the maintenance key to use to report problems with the Flare software.</p>
            <p>When upgrading the software, the Technical Writer Manager assigns one writer to upgrade and test the upgrade for Flare. The writer who tests the upgrade performs the following checks:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Build each Target in each Flare project to make sure there are no build errors.</p>
                    <p class="note"><b>NOTE:</b> If there are build errors export the build log and report the issue to Flare support.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Check the output to make sure that the master pages are applied correctly.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Click on all clickable items and verify they work as expected (for example the arrow drop down menu next to the logo in the header).</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Verify that the feedback link in the topic footer works.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Make sure the print and Remove Highlights icons in the Help toolbar work.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>For the SST Help project if everything checks out, commit a build to source control and make sure that the Context Sensitive Help is working as expected in a test SST environment.</p>
            <p>Once the build is confirmed working in the SST test environment, notify the Documentation Team that they can upgrade.</p>
