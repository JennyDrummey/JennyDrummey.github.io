        <h2>Dev/PM/Others Add Tickets Manually in Jira</h2>
        <p>The default Documentation Status setting when a Jira ticket is created is Not Started.</p>
        <p>Technical Writers track all documentation content in JIRA, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>New features and updates</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>All Bug issues</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Customer Support issues</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Other tickets (tasks, defects) that describe changes to behavior or the UI that were previously released.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Online Help feedback, tracked on the DocTeam ToDos board. Refer to <a href="BOADocProcess_IncorpFeedbackPrint.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Incorporating User Feedback</a>.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note">
            <b>NOTE</b>: Technical Writers enter issues related to how the online help works, and unrelated to content (as in, typos, broken links, Map ID corrections) on the DocTeamToDos board in JIRA.</p>
        <p>The process begins in Jira when PM/Dev move a ticket from the backlog to the DSP70 board for the current release (SST and Install Manual), or when tickets move onto the Kyber board (SKT)</p>
