        <h2><a name="Create"></a>Create New Topic</h2>
        <p>To create a topic:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>In the Content Explorer pane, right-click the Content folder, and then select New &gt; Topic (or Ctrl+T).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Select NewTopic.htm under New from Template.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Enter the File Name using underscores, save the file to the correct path, (component name/Config, Page Desc or Use Cases) and then click Add.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Note: When Flare compiles file names, it embeds the entire file path string in the file name. If the file path string and file name combine into more than 99 characters, it will cause issues when recycling old checkout folders. Name file names and folders using as few characters as possible.</p>

        <h2><a name="Editing"></a>Editing content already in Help to send for Review</h2>
        <p>When existing Help content needs to be updated, generate a Word document containing the content from Flare or cut and paste content into a Google document. Then, once generated, turn on Track Changes and update the content as needed. Attach the updated Word document to the Jira ticket and send for review as noted in the following sections.</p>
        <p>To generate a Word document from Flare:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>In the Project Organizer, open the TOCs folder.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Create a new TOC in the TOCs folder and copy the TOC that includes the content you will be updating.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Open the PrintTOC.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Click and hold the tab for the PrintTOC, and then drag it to float next to the Copy of ConsoleTOC”</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>In the new TOC, locate the topic or book with the content to be edited and drag it to the PrintTOC.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Save the PrintTOC (you can close both TOCs at this point).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Open the Target Folder, and then open the Word target.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>On the General Tab, click the browse option next to Output Folder and select where you want Flare to generate the document (you can select your Desktop, for example).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>On the Variables tab, update the ComponentName variable as needed.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Click Build.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>The Word document is generated. You can open the document from the Builds pod, or click View in the Target editor.</p>
        <p>Tip: If you only have one or two topics to update you can just copy and paste the content into a Google document and include the link in the JIRA ticket.</p>
        <p>Note: Please delete the new TOC you created before you push your updates up to GitHub to avoid having many extra TOCs hanging around in the project.</p>
        <h2><a name="Use"></a>Use Condition Tags</h2>
        <p>Condition tags serve two purposes. A condition tag is applied to almost every topic in the Content Explorer in Flare to identify the specific component to which it belongs.</p>
        <p>Condition tags are also used in an output Target to include/exclude entire topics or certain text in a topic from Help output. This allows generations of the two online help systems described in the next section. If a topic must be excluded from one of the Help systems, the condition tag also must be applied to the topic’s TOC link in the TOC.</p>
        <h2><a name="Types"></a>Types of Help Systems Output from Flare</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>For SST, two online help systems are output from Flare, Full and Solex.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The condition tags to be include or excluded in these outputs are configured in the Target used to build the output. Refer to Build Help Targets</p>
        <p>Refer to <a href="BOADocProcess_CondTags.html">Condition Tags Used in the Project File</a> for information about which condition tags are included/excluded for each help system.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>For SKT, one help system is built and published. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>For Syniti Guides, two sets of manuals are available online. </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2><a name="Apply"></a>Apply Condition Tag to a Topic</h2>
        <p>A condition tag must be applied to almost every topic in the Content Explorer to identify the topic’s component. The condition tag must be applied to the topic’s link in the master TOC as well.</p>
        <p>Note: Content that displays in both versions of help does not have a CT. This includes DSP Navigation and How to Use Online Help topics, and other general topics.</p>
        <p>To apply a condition tag to an entire topic:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Select the topic in the Content Explorer.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Right-click the topic and select Properties.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>In the topic Properties dialog, click the Conditional Text tab.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Click the check box next to the Condition Tag to apply it to the topic.</p>

        <h2><a name="Add3"></a>Add Popups for Frequently Referenced Content</h2>
        <p>Some fields that have multiple options are referenced throughout the online help, such as Report Type. To maintain content in one location rather than repeating it every time the field is mentioned, add the content to the popups object in the custom.js file and add a link with the”popUpLink” class and appropriate id (the title of the content inserted as the key in the key value pair).</p>
        <p>To view the popups that have already been created in the project, open the custom.js file and view the popups object.</p>

        <p>When a user clicks the ? icon on any page in the product, the help system opens and displays the field description topic for that page. This is referred to as Context-sensitive Help.</p>
        <p>When documenting a new page, enter a Map ID that links the page with the topic name in Flare. The Map ID, coupled with an Alias Value in Flare, links a page in the product with a topic in the help file. In the SST implementation of online help, a Map ID is the GUID for a page.</p>
        <p>Each component has a range for an alias file Value. Refer to <a href="BOADocProcess_AliasValueRange.html">Alias File Value Range</a> to see a table of values by component.</p>

        <p>New concept added to Concepts list in Flare</p>
        <p>Note: If you drag a lot of topics from the TOC to the Concepts list, Flare has a lag, it won’t respond to mouse clicks, (because it is working in the background to add all of the topics) there will be a little screen flash when it’s done, and then you know the topics have been added. (This only happens when you add A LOT of topics.) Flare really should have a progress bar when that happens!</p>
        <p>Tip: You can expand the node in the Concepts list to see what topics are included.</p>

        <p>Expanded node in Concepts list</p>
        <p>Once you have the concepts added to the topics, you can add the filter for it to the Search Filters.</p>
        <p>Note: This has already been set up in the project. It is included as background information.</p>
        <p>To add concepts to Search Filters:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Open the Search Filter file in the Advanced folder.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Click Plus to add the filter, and double-click in the Filter name field to give it a name.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Note: This is the name that shows up in the drop-down in the Output.</p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>
                <p>Press Enter on your keyboard.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Double-click in the Concepts field and associate the concept to the filter.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/assocConcepts.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Associate concepts with filters</p>
        <p>Tip: When a user selects the filter in the output, Flare only searches within topics that have the concept.</p>
