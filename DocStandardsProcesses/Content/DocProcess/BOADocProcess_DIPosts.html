        <p>- Ensure answers don't violate support rules </p>
        <p>- Ensure solution is correct </p>

        <h3 id="the-documentation-teams-responsibilities">The Documentation Team’s Responsibilities</h3>
        <p>The <strong>Documentation team</strong> responsibilities are to:</p>

        <p>- Review content for standards: </p>

        <p>- If a user included their name in the post, leave it as is. Aliases are to be kept bold. </p>
        <p>- Remove client references (replace the client’s name with something generic, for example, the client)</p>
        <p> - Revise the post title to summarize the post in the form of a question (by default, the title is the first few words of the post) </p>
        <p>- Remove references to attachments. (Files were not imported into Data Insiders from cConnect). If unsure that the post can stand alone without the attachment reference, contact Support for guidance.</p>
        <p> - Make note of any posts that would be good candidates for Data Insiders blog articles.</p>
