        <h1>Update Migrate Help</h1>
        <p class="note"><b>NOTE:</b> This section assumes you have access to the <a href="https://concento.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Azure ticketing system</a> that developers use to track the Migrate project. Contact the Migrate PM for access. 
</p>
        <p>The Documentation team updates online help for Syniti Migrate once a month. This includes:
</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>The release notes 
</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The pre-release notes
</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Updates to the online help that are the result of changes in that month’s sprint. 
</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The monthly sprints are tracked in Azure. To view them, select Sprints in the left menu. You can view previous and next month’s sprints using the list box. </p>

        </p>
        <p>As each ticket moves through the development process in Azure, once it is tested, it is assigned a status of Document and the Technical Writer receives an email that a ticket is ready for review. </p>
        <p>Tickets that must be mentioned in the release notes are tagged with YYMMR.</p>
        <p>Tickets that must not be mentioned in the release notes are tagged with YYMMN, though these tickets may result in updates to online help. For example, the name of a page may be updated or the order of icons on a page may shift.</p>
        <p class="note"><b>NOTE:</b> The Technical Writer can ask the PM to consider including a ticket in the release notes if the TW thinks the ticket should be included and it has been marked as not for release.</p>
        <p>To view all tickets by tag, click Tags in the left menu, then click the arrow next to the tag.</p>

        <h2>Working Release Notes Document</h2>
        <p>Here is an example of the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jeoHiZnIBFDUNa4mKi8jxem4zqXOzxmxTecU3rCS66Y/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June release notes</a>.</p>
        <p>Keep a googledoc with the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>A table to track all tickets tagged with YYMMR</p>
                <p class="note"><b>NOTE:</b> If the ticket does not have a tag, add a comment, and ask the PM if it should be included or removed when it’s getting close to publication.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>For each ticket, a bookmark to the release notes documentation below the table</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Links to online help updates to separate documents in the body of the release notes, just as they will appear in the final Flare project.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>A table of tickets that are marked as YYMMN, but do affect the online help.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Publication Schedule</h2>
        <p>Migrate sprints for a month start at the middle of the month, two month’s previous. For example, the sprint for June started in the middle of April. This allows for dev, testing and documentation to be finished in time for the monthly release.</p>
        <p>Migrate release notes and help updates are released on the first Friday of the month. These notes also need to be prepared a week ahead of time for the pre-release notes.</p>
        <p>Prepare release notes content by the Wednesday before the week the release notes will be released so that they are ready for pre-release notes. For example, the publication date of the June release notes for 2023 is June 2, 2023. The pre-release notes must be ready by Wednesday May 24.</p>
        <h2>Update Migrate Help</h2>
        <p>To update Migrate help:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Create the Migrate Release Notes [month name] googledoc, and track the tickets and write the documentation throughout the month. Do so as early as possible, considering the release notes must be ready for the pre-release notes date.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If a ticket moves to Document status and is tagged YYMMN, and if it does not affect the online help, change the status to Closed. If it does require a help update, add the ticket to the appropriate table in the googledoc before closing the ticket.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>When all the month’s release notes tickets have been written, ask for a PM review.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Once the updates are approved, add the release notes document to the release-notes Slack channel.</p>
                <p class="note"><b>NOTE:</b> The release notes updates are included in the pre-release notes, and in the first Friday of the month’s release notes.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The Technical Writer responsible for the Migrate help content should make the online help updates in Flare as close to the first Friday of the month as possible, for example, the Thursday afternoon before the release. Refer to <a href="UpdateOnlineHelp.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Update Online Help</a> for more information. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>After the changes have been made in Flare and the release notes and help updates have been released, change the status of the remaining MMYYR tickets to Closed. Include a link to the release notes document in the comments. </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
