        <h1>Add Duplicate Links for Solex Versions</h1>
        <p>When a Solex version of the product is created (roughly twice a year), links between the SST and the Installation Manuals must be updated. All links between the Installation Guide project and the SST help must have a Full version and a Solex version of that link so that the user is directed to the correct documentation.</p>
        <p>
