        <h1>SKP Help</h1>
        <p>SKP Help is more dynamic as it is working in a cloud environment where the changes made to this system are made live and active each week.  There are no versions.  Most of documentation’s steps are exactly the same as for SST. The steps are listed below:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Prepare the help content as described in the  <a href="BOADocProcess_DSPDocOverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Documentation Process Overview</a>. Only content approved by a PM&#160;or Dev should be added to the help. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Inform the Doc Team in the doc_checkouts Slack channel that you are going to check out the Help.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><a href="#Synchron" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Synchronize your local repo develop branch with the remote develop branch and create a new branch.</a>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Make updates within Flare and note them in your <a href="BOADocProcess_Workflow_Approved.html#Author" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Author Notes</a>. </p>
                <p class="note"><b>NOTE</b>: If you are making changes to the What's New topic and they are the first changes made in a month, you must <a href="#Add" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">add that month to the drop-down list that displays on the What's New page</a>. </p>
            </li>

                <p class="note"><b>NOTE</b>: Pushing content to develop automatically starts a build in jenkins called ‘<b>CloudDocsDev</b>’ to build the new content in the dev site. There is no need to access jenkins when updating SKP help (unless to check for failure issues).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>When the changes are available on the develop site, ask for a peer review. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>When the <a href="#PeerReview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">peer review</a> is complete, <a href="#Merge">merge the develop branch to the master branch</a> to push the changes to the prod environment. </p>

                <p>The new pull request will default with the <b>base:</b> develop and the <b>compare:</b> master. Update both fields to base: master and compare:develop - in this way the develop is being pushed to the master as shown below.</p>

            <li>
                <p>Click the <b>Merge</b> then <b>Confirm Merge</b> buttons to complete this process. The master will now match the develop for igc-help project.</p>
                <p class="note"><b>NOTE</b>: Pushing content to master automatically starts a build in jenkins called ‘<b>CloudDocsProd</b>’ to build the new content in the prod site. There is no need to access jenkins when updating SKP help (unless to check for failure issues).</p>
