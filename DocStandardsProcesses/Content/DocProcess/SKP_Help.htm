        <h1>SKP Help</h1>
        <p>SKP Help is more dynamic as it is working in a cloud environment where the changes made to this system are made live and active each week.  There are no versions.  Most of documentation’s steps are exactly the same except for the ones listed below:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Prepare the help content as described in the  <a href="BOADocProcess_DSPDocOverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Documentation Process Overview</a>. Only content approved by a PM&#160;or Dev should be added to the help. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Inform the Doc Team in the doc_checkouts Slack channel that you are going to check out the Help.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><a href="#Synchron" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Synchronize your local repo develop branch with the remote develop branch and create a new branch.</a>
                </p>

            <li>
                <p>Make updates and note them in your <a href="BOADocProcess_Workflow_Approved.html#Author" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Author Notes</a>. </p>
                <p class="note"><b>NOTE</b>: If you are making changes to the What's New topic and they are the first changes made in a month, you must <a href="#Add" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">add that month to the drop-down list that displays on the What's New page</a>. </p>
            </li>
            <li>

                <p><a href="BOADocProcess_Workflow_Approved.html#Author3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Merge your changes to the develop branch</a>. This will automatically start a jenkins job that will copy the updated help system to the dev environment.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>When the changes are available on the develop site, ask for a peer review. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>When the peer review is complete, <a href="#Merge">merge the develop branch to the master branch</a> to push the changes to the prod environment. </p>

            <li>

            </li>
            <li> Enter git command <span style="font-family: Consolas; font-weight: bold;">git checkout -b BranchName</span> to create a personal branch in which to make edits, where <span style="font-family: Consolas;">BranchName</span> is a brief description of the branch.</li>

        <h2><a name="Build"></a>Build a Target</h2>
        <p>These steps will build out the target so that the documentation may be viewed as it will online in the dev or prod environments. A build may be run at any time, however, do not run a Publish as it will cause issues to the project. </p>
        <p>To build a target in Flare:</p>
