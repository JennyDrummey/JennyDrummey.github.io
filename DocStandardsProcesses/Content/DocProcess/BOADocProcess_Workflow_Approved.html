        <p class="note"><b>NOTE: </b>All Documentation Team members belong to the doc_checkouts Slack channel, where we post information about what is being worked on and what needs review. Use the @doc command to notify the team that you are checking out a branch and to request a peer review. </p>
        <p>Authors work in Flare on a group of tickets at a time or a chunk of content at a time. You can decide how to group them. You may want to add all content for an Epic, or all of your assigned tickets for a release. It’s up to you.</p>
        <p>Authors are responsible for producing Author Notes for the content.</p>
        <p>Authors are responsible for content getting to the dev environment for testing for the Peer Review.</p>

        <p>Important: <a href="BOADocProcess_GitInitSetup.html">GitHub Initial Setup</a> contains the initial configuration and setup steps for Git and GitHub. These steps must be performed by a new employee.</p>
        <p>Important: Always use Git Bash. Do not use the GitHub Desktop application.</p>
        <p>Warning: You MUST perform these steps each time you checkout a branch to ensure you are working in the latest copy of the release branch.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>In Windows-Explorer, right-click your local repo folder and select Git Bash Here.</p>

        <p>Tip: If you are working on a big project where you perform several checkins before opening a Pull Request, use the following commands each time you begin work: <span style="font-family: Consolas;">git status &lt;your branch name&gt;</span> then <span style="font-family: Consolas;">git checkout &lt;your branch name&gt;</span> then <span style="font-family: Consolas;">git pull origin &lt;your branch name&gt;</span></p>
