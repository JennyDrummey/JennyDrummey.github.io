        <p>The following is a list of useful git commands:</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Discard Changes from File:</strong> To discard changes made to a single file, use the command $ git checkout – “file name”<br /><strong>NOTE:</strong> Include quotation marks around the file name to ensure that spaces are not mistaken for delimiters.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Discard Changes made to Branch:</strong> To discard all changes made to a branch since the previous commit, use the command $ git reset –hard HEAD</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Stash Changes:</strong> To stash changes made to a file that might be discarded or committed later, use the command $ git stash<br />Refer to <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Git-Tools-Stashing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Git - Stashing</a> for more information.</p>

        <h3 id="terminology">Terminology</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Repository:</strong> A repository is a folder inside which you are going to store your project. You can have a local repository on your computer as well as a remote repository, located on GitHub. It is also referred to as a directory.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Branch:</strong> A branch is a copy of the repository and can be made based on whatever branch is available. We make branches in Git so that any changes that are made are not merged or added to the main content until everything has been finalized and approved.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Merge:</strong> Merging a branch means you are combining the changes from one branch into another. We do this when we have a new feature’s content approved.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Fetch:</strong> When you fetch a remote repository you are contacting GitHub and pulling any changes that may have been made to the project files to whatever branch you are on in your local repository.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Push:</strong> When you push your changes to the remote repository you are updating the help files on GitHub with your changes. Once you have pushed, other writers can now fetch your changes and update their own local repos with what you have done.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Commit:</strong> After you have made changes to your local copy of the help files you need to commit them for the changes to be made to your local repository. Once a commit it made it must then be pushed to the remote repository so that other writers can access the changes.</p>
        <h3 id="background">Background</h3>
        <p>Git is a distributed version control system. Git is known as a “distributed” (rather than "centralized") version control system because you can run it locally and disconnected from the Internet, and then “push” your changes to a remote system (such as GitHub) whenever you like. Git tracks content rather than files. Branches are lightweight and merging is easy. It's distributed, so basically every repository is a branch.</p>
        <p>GitHub facilitates teams working on the same project by providing a web interface to the Git code repository and management tools for collaboration. GitHub allows team members to change, adapt and improve a project from its repositories. Each public or private repository contains all of a project's files, as well as each file's revision history. Repositories can have multiple collaborators and can be either public or private.</p>
        <p>For our use of Git and GitHub, we have opted to use the <a href="https://gitforwindows.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Git Bash</a> command line.</p>
