        <h1>Update Online Help</h1>
        <p>What to document?&#160;At the start of a release (for the Stewardship Tier) or a mission (for the Knowledge Platform), review all the tickets to determine which ones need documenting. If documentation isn't required, go ahead and set the Documentation Status to "Not Required." </p>
        <h2>Stewardship Tier</h2>
        <p>At the start of a new release, all Tech Writers take a look at the Jira tickets and assigns themselves to the tickets they want to document. Pretty much every ticket gets documented. Anything that deals with investigation or the PQ usually doesn't get documented. </p>
        <h2>Knowledge Platform</h2>
        <p>If you're the writer assigned to a mission, set yourself as the Writer Assigned for all tickets within the mission's epic. </p>
        <p>Unlike the Stewardship Tier, not every Knowledge Platform ticket is documented. Only document tickets that impact the user interface or how a user interacts with the Knowledge Platform. Tickets that describe back-end changes to the product are not documented. If the Affected Environment(s) for the ticket is only "Development," the ticket does not require documentation. When in doubt, reach out to the Doc Team or the mission’s PM for help on deciding if the ticket requires documentation.</p>
