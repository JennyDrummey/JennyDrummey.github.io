        <h1>Checklist for Generating Online Help for Release</h1>
        <p>The checks in the following sections are completed prior to a product release and after all approved content has been added to the Help project.</p>
        <h2>Review Flare Reports, CT Assignments, and Alias File Identifiers</h2>
        <p>Complete the following tasks in Flare prior to generating Help for a product release.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>On the <b>Analysis</b> tab, click the <b>Links</b> group and select <b>Broken Bookmarks</b>, and resolve any bookmark issues. Then select <b>Broken Links</b> and resolve any hyperlink issues.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="note"><b>NOTE</b>: Flare scans the database for issues during this task and displays text that says Scanning while doing so. Ensure the scan is complete before preceding to the next step. When the scan is complete, the message found no entries displays.</p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">

Sort the file list on the second column with colored squares, which indicate a CT has been applied to that topic. For those uncolored squares (those topics that do not have a CT applied, evaluate if the page needs a CT applied. Only .htm files need master pages applied.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>

        <p class="note"><b>NOTE</b>: The popup topics and the What’s New topics for previous releases are always going to be on this report but do not need to be added to the TOC.</p>
        <p class="note"><b>NOTE</b>: The report engine topics are being researched in DSP-4753 and are not an issue when generating the Help.</p>
        <h2>Review the Generated Help System</h2>
        <p>Once Help is generated for a release, complete the following checks in the online Help system.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Review the What’s New topic to verify:</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>The topic has the correct version number in the title</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>All of the links work</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Topic is free of formatting and grammar issues</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>
                <p>Open the Overview topic for each component and verify:</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>The correct component button displays</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The copyright year is the current year</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Update the SST Landing Page</h2>
        <p>For each release the SST Landing Page’s index.htm needs to be updated with new release links for the general and solex versions of the Help and What’s New. If a user enters an invalid url for the help, this page displays, listing all available versions of the product.</p>
        <p>To update the index.htm page:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Open the <b>DSPLandingPage</b> folder in the Root of the dsp-docs directory.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Open <b>index.html</b> in a text editor like VS Code or Atom.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Around lines 68 and 86, you will see the general links to the What’s New page and the Help. Add links to the new release in the same format as the prior release. Test the link once it has been added to the file to ensure it works.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Around lines 111 and 130, you will see the solex links to the What’s New page and the Help. Add links to the new release in the same format as the prior release. Test the link once it has been added to the file to ensure it works.</p>
                <p class="note"><b>NOTE</b>: Not every release is sent to SAP. There are releases of Syniti help without corresponding SAP help releases.</p>
