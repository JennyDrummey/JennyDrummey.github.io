        <p>User feedback may require input from PM if the updates are a substantial change to how the functionality is described. If the user feedback is about a typo, formatting issue, or is content that should be updated because it is incorrect, follow the second set of steps below. </p>
        <p class="note"><b>NOTE</b>:&#160;Add a bullet with information about what user feedback we've incorporated in a given release in the What's New topic, under Help Enhancement Requests from Users. </p>

        <p>User feedback process if the suggestion is an update to content that needs to be reviewed by PM:</p>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>Tech Writers receive an email sent from the feedback email either from the online help or the Installation Manual.</li>
            <li>TW confirms issue, then responds to confirm receipt and lets the user know that PM must review the changes, and TW will let them know the outcome.</li>
            <li>
                <p>Tech Writer adds this information to a JIRA issue. </p>
                <p class="note"><b>NOTE</b>: Enter the issue on the DocTeamToDos board.</p>
            </li>
            <li>TW assigns the issue to the PM for feedback.</li>
            <li>TW adds a note in the issue description that the request came from the help feedback, and was submitted by the submitter’s name.</li>
            <li>
                <p>PM evaluates whether the update should be included in the help and assigns a fix version as needed.</p>
                <p class="note"> <b>NOTE</b>: All updates are included in the in-process version of the manual. Some may require updates to the previously released versions of help.</p>
            </li>
            <li>PM adds a note to the issue and assigns it back to the TW who entered the ticket.</li>
            <li>TW updates documentation following the standard process, or closes the ticket, depending on PM feedback.</li>
            <li>TW emails submitter with resolution, if an update was made, or if one was not.</li>
