        <h1>Create Weekly SKP Release Notes</h1>
        <p>Tech Writers and PM (Jon, Emily,  Andy and Caroline) work together to create the weekly release notes for Syniti Knowledge Platform (SKP).</p>
        <p class="note"><b>NOTE</b>: The weekly update is for these systems - SKP, Replicate, and Match (as of Oct ‘22). Both Construct and Migrate produce monthly release notes per their cadence.</p>
        <p class="note">At a high level, PM produces the bulk of the release notes by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Pulling the filtered list of PRs each week from the skt-ui repo.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Reviewing the list and, using track changes, deleting PRs that are not relevant.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Providing details for the PRs where the provided descriptions are not enough.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>To start the process, on Friday morning of each week, PM runs the query as described below.</p>
        <p>As a PM, to produce the release notes: </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Right-click the skt-ui folder for your local repo and select <b>Git Bash Here</b>.</p>
                <p class="note"><b>NOTE</b>: If pulling down this branch for the first time, enter the git command <b>git fetch origin main</b>, then proceed with the following steps.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Enter the git command <b>git pull origin main</b></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Run this command:</p>
                <p><b>git log --pretty=format:%s --since="7 days ago" | cat</b>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Copy the line above, right click on Git Bash Here and paste, click enter.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Highlight the text in the console, right-click and select <b>Copy</b>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Create a google doc with the name <b>SKP Release Notes mm/dd/yy</b>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Paste the console’s list of changes into this document.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Review the list of issues and, using track changes, delete any you think could be excluded.</p>
                <p class="note"><b>NOTE</b>: If it’s not clear what work is associated with a PR from the name alone you may need to  copy the description from the PR. See the steps for <a href="#find_PR">getting the description from the PR</a> below.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Post a note in the Slack channel #release-notes asking the other PMs for review and feedback. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Once PM&#160;feedback has been incorporated, let the Tech Writers know in the #release-notes channel that they are ready to post.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The Technical Writer makes changes to the google doc following the <a href="#Std">standards listed below</a>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The Technical Writer posts a note in the  #release-notes channel to ask for peer review from other writers before adding the content to help. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>After the peer review is done, the Technical Writer adds the weekly updates to SCReleases.htm file in the Flare project igc-help <a href="https://jennydrummey.github.io/Content/DocProcess/SKP_Help.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">following these steps</a>.
