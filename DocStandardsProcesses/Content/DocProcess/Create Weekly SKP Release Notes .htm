        <h1>Create Weekly SKP Release Notes</h1>
        <p>Tech Writers and PM (Jon, Emily,  Andy and Caroline) work together to create the weekly release notes for Syniti Knowledge Platform (SKP).</p>
        <p class="note"><b>NOTE</b>: The weekly update is for the SKP, Migrate, Construct and Orchestrate. Other modules are note yet released. Both Construct and Migrate produce monthly release notes per their cadence.</p>
        <p class="note">At a high level, PM produces the bulk of the release notes by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Pulling the filtered list of PRs each week from the skt-ui repo.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Reviewing the list and, using track changes, deleting PRs that are not relevant.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Running a query in Jira to see which issues were tested successfully in prod. The release notes should only include these issues.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Providing details for the PRs where the provided descriptions are not enough.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>To start the process, on Friday morning of each week, PM runs the query as described below.</p>
        <p>As a PM, to produce the release notes: </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Run the following query: <span style="font-family: monospace;">project="KYB" AND "Test Status[Labels]"="ProdTested"</span>. Refer to <a href="#RunQueryInJira">Run a Query in Jira</a> for more information.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Review the tickets that have been updated last and compare them to what was listed in the previous week's release notes.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Draft the release notes in a Google doc with the name<b> SKP Release Notes mm/dd/yy</b>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Post a note in the Slack channel #release-notes asking the other PMs for review and feedback. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Once PM&#160;feedback has been incorporated, let the Tech Writers know in the #release-notes channel that they are ready to post.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The Technical Writer makes changes to the google doc following the <a href="#Std">standards listed below</a>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The Technical Writer posts a note in the  #release-notes channel to ask for peer review from other writers before adding the content to help. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>After the peer review is done, the Technical Writer adds the weekly updates to SCReleases.htm file in the Flare project igc-help <a href="https://jennydrummey.github.io/Content/DocProcess/SKP_Help.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">following these steps</a>. Add a new month if needed. <a href="#Example">Examples are provided</a>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Once published in Flare, post the release notes in the #skp_releases channel. <a href="#Slack">Example provided below</a>.</p>
