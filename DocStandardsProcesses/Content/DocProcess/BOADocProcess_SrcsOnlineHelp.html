        <h2>JIRA Issues</h2>
        <p>The Product Owner/PM enters new features/updates for all products in Jira. When the ticket is being worked for a release, a jira ticket is added and moved to a Kanban board.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Syniti Knowledge Platform tickets are tracked on the <a href="https://entota.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=153" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SKP Doc Board</a> in the Syniti Knowledge Platform project</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p> Syniti Stewardship Tier tickets are tracked on the <a href="https://entota.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=165" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SST Doc Board</a> in the Syniti Stewardship Tier project</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>When creating a ticket, the reporter:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Completes the Fix Version/s field for each issue, ensuring that all issues in scope for a release have the correct version number.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Includes information in the story ticket and associated subtasks for all issues requiring documentation.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>After a product’s initial release, product updates are also tracked as separate JIRA issues. To ensure that all issues in scope for the release are included in the documentation, the Technical Writer searches on the release number in the Fix Version/s field when reviewing issues for inclusion in documentation.</p>
        <h2>Confluence One-pagers</h2>
        <p>The Product Manager must create the one pagers describing the new feature/mission. This page should serve as the requirements and should provide enough information for a Technical Writer to create content. <br /></p>
        <h2>Online Help</h2>
        <p>Search in the help for background information and content that can be referenced or modified when writing about updates to products.</p>
        <h2>Meetings with Project Team Members</h2>
        <p>Content can also come from Deep Dives and meetings with Development/PM/QE.</p>
        <h2>Development Slack Channels</h2>
        <p>Writers can also get answers from feature/product specific slack channels if one has been created, or by direct messaging the PM or lead developer listed on the JIRA ticket.</p>
        <h2>Support</h2>
        <p>Support may have first-hand knowledge of how the products are used and can be helpful in supplying examples or verifying if something is accurate. Search the KB if you are writing about an updated feature. There may be background information in an article.</p>
