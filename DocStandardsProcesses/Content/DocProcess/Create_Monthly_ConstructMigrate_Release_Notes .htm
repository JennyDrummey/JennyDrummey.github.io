        <h1>Create Monthly Construct and Migrate Release Notes</h1>
        <p>Syniti Construct and Syniti Migrate release monthly and have a list of tickets to be completed. The standup meetings discuss the list of open tickets and progress of development work. As each ticket transitions from New through to Dev/Test status for development, a Technical Writer is assigned to the ticket and the ticket is worked for documentation.</p>
        <p>If the ticket has no requirement for documentation, it is changed to status of Not Required and the Technical Writer field will be made blank.</p>
        <p>The process for completing the documentation is defined in the <a href="BOADocProcess_UpdateOnlineHelp.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Update Online Help</a> section of Document Processes.</p>
        <p>During the month, since these updates are not yet released to the public, they are assigned a <a href="BOADocProcess_CondTags.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Conditional Tag</a> to hide them. These pages are also set as not searchable.</p>
        <h2>Monthly Cadence</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>TW writes content based on Jira tickets in TEST status for these projects, has them reviewed by PM, and adds this content to the project using a CT called NotYetReleased.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The TW keeps track of all changes made. Link the tickets in an epic (Ex: [MONTHNAME] Construct Migrate Docs).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The TW adds approved content to the project throughout the month, using the CT to hide it.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>At the end of the month, the primary TW is @mentioned in a Jira ticket (ex: <a href="https://entota.atlassian.net/browse/DSP70-1924" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[DSP70-1924] Deploy Latest Construct build to Production - Syniti JIRA (atlassian.net)</a>) that indicates the push to prod. This ticket tells CloudOps to push the production version of the products to the server.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The TW responds on the ticket by confirming that the help is being pushed to prod.</p>
                <p class="note"><b>NOTE</b>: If the primary writer doesn’t respond within a few hours, the secondary TW is @mentioned. If the secondary TW does not respond in a few hours, send an email to Dylan/Jenny.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The TW removes the CTs from that month’s content, then rebuilds the SKP help on the dev and prod sites.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Once complete, the TW adds a confirmation that the help is ready in production.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="note"><b>NOTE</b>: During this phase</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Syniti Construct and Syniti Migrate pages are searchable.</p>

            <li>
                <p>Updates to Construct and Migrate display on the What’s New released to the public.</p>
