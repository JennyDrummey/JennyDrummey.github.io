                    <h3>Add Row Source</h3>
                    <p>A table in the source database that contains source object data that is moved to a target table. A source’s system type determines the database schema, or table definitions, for the source. Add an Add Row source if another source database object is needed from the same system for the same target table. For example, the same source system has two tables for customers, one table contains SoldTos and another contains ShipTos. Both these tables are in the same system and need to be migrated to the target table ttKNA1.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>After Post Rule</h3>
                    <p>A rule (a business rule, collect download or status view), registered to a process template in Integrate, that runs after the process template executes successfully and before the next process template begins processing (if posting with a multi-template process). For a multi-template process, when a process template with an After Post Rule registered posts successfully, the data is passed to the next dependent template process as an input parameter.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Assemble</h3>

                </li>
                <li> <h3>AutoGen</h3><p>Process that automatically creates rules and objects based on configuration in Target Design. SQL AutoGen create basic objects used by the migration process (tables, rules and reports). Data Services AutoGen generates Data Services Jobs that perform target enrichments and validations. Data Services AutoGen also runs a set of standard validations (format checks, target value mapping checks and field status checks).</p></li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Automation Engine</h3>
                    <p>Allows for the programmatic creating and processing of instructions, for example, creating rules in Collect. Instructions can only be automated from within a single data source.</p>

                <li>
                    <h3>Basic Rule</h3>
                    <p>Conditional or default (one that populates the field with a default value) rule created in Target Design and used in AutoGen to apply conditions to up to three combined fields.</p>
                </li>
                <li> <h3>BDC Script</h3><p>Batch Data Communication script recorded using either Integrate or the SHDB transaction in SAP. The script results are used to post data to SAP from Integrate and Mass Maintenance. For example, BDC scripts can be used to create a customer, then add customer address details.</p></li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Breakpoint</h3>
                    <p>Stops rule or report processing in Transform at a specified place to assist when troubleshooting an issue. Make changes to a rule or report, then add a breakpoint to stop the job before the rule or report is run to see if the fix was successful. Breakpoints can be set for target source rules, target source reports, target rules and target reports.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Bulk Execution</h3>
                    <p>Ability to run an event on a Stewardship Tier page for all records or a subset of those records via a simple, guided user experience. Bulk Execution can be used on any page where it is activated by the page designer.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Business Contact</h3>
                    <p>Type of user in Target Design used for reporting purposes who automatically receives published reports from Transform.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Catalog</h3>
                    <p>Provides a means to populate and administer translations, help text and alias values at the WebApp and page levels.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Check Table</h3>
                    <p>Table that stores the target field and value used in value mapping. A legacy (source) field and value is converted to a value in the lookup table (also called a check table) that the target system accepts in the target table. For example, if two companies merge, the legacy org numbers can be converted and then value mapped to new org numbers (stored in an org number lookup table) in the target ERP system.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Closed Loop Remediation</h3>
                    <p>A process that uses Data Quality to facilitate data correction. After rules are run, a WebApp generates error reports, then sends the reports to the roles responsible for the data via a workflow. The roles fix the errors and post the corrected data to the target system. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.ISA">For example, after rules run in IS, the ISA creates a request in Mass Maintenance. Using the workflow, the data is assigned to the role responsible for fixing the errors, and drives the data correction, review and posting of the corrected data via Integrate.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Collect</h3>
                    <p>A data repository management component that is a core entity of many Stewardship Tier product offerings. Collect maintains a unified collection of data from multiple, disparate systems without requiring users to connect to the actual systems. It can be configured to extract the data at scheduled intervals and at an individual table level. In this way, the data can be kept in sync based on the processing schedule of each data source. Collect also contains import groups to organize and manage sets of tables.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Common</h3>

                    <h3>Construct</h3>
                    <p>A component of ADM that assists in creating, enhancing and converting data to load into the target system. Construct eliminates the inconsistency of maintaining multiple spreadsheets and provides a single location where users can update or directly enter data. Construction pages are used to enter or modify data required by the target ERP system that doesn’t currently exist in the source system(s).</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Context</h3>
                    <p>Combination of a wave and process area created in Console to which an object, target and source are assigned.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>CTS</h3>
                    <p>Change and Transport System (CTS) migrates objects from a source instance to a target instance of the Stewardship Tier. Each WebApp has a pre-defined set of objects that can be moved.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Data Quality Scoring</h3>
                    <p>A process that uses industry standard calculations to calculate data quality. These calculations are used in Data Quality to determine a data quality score at the category (Groups, Objects, and Applications) and report level.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Data Services AutoGen</h3>
                    <p>A component of ADM that provides the ability to generate Data Services Jobs that perform target enrichments and validations, including post load validation of the data loaded into the target application. Using the AutoGen request options in the Stewardship Tier, users send the metadata required to generate the Data Services Jobs for the specific target to the dspCloud™ for processing. Data Services Jobs are created based on Target Design. Once generated, the Jobs are registered in Transform as Data Services rules.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Syniti Data Replication</h3>

                    <p>A workflow-enabled application to govern the entry, review and approval of a proposed mass change. Users are assigned to roles, which are associated with templates. A template aligns with a single BDC or GUI script, an Integrate template, or a custom template, and can be reused for multiple requests. A request drives the workflow process to mass change a single object in SAP.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3 MadCap:conditions="Primary.dspConduct">Master Data Management</h3>
                    <p MadCap:conditions="Primary.dspConduct">A component that provides an Application Data Management solution for governing data business processes across disparate applications and infrastructures. MDM provides the ability to design, execute, and monitor business processes within an organization as they relate to the creation and maintenance of data within the enterprise architecture of an organization. A Designer creates the governance elements hierarchy, where tasks, roles, scenarios, business processes and their dependencies are defined.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Data Quality/Enhanced Migration Reporting</h3>
                    <p>The analytical component of the Stewardship Tier that facilitates reporting on and maintaining high quality master data.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>dspTrack™</h3>
                    <p>A project tracking tool used to ensure project tasks are completed according to a project schedule and to alert managers when tasks and projects are in danger of being late or are late.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Enrichment Construction</h3>
                    <p>Source used when legacy data does not exist for a field or a number of fields. A construction page is created that contains only the mapped field, not all active fields for the target. For example, a construction page could be created that contains a field from a particular object, such as Material UOM or Vendors Fax Number. The field is required by SAP but the field does not exist in the source system and the value for that field cannot be inferred.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Excel Integration</h3>
                    <p>Feature that allows users to import data from Excel into Stewardship Tier pages.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>External Data Role</h3>
                    <p>Role type in Mass Maintenance that receives a spreadsheet with current request data via email when a request is created. The spreadsheet contains only required columns for adding (or in the case of validation failures, updating) request data. When a user creates a request based on a template with an External Data role, Mass Maintenance sends an email with an Excel file attached to the external contact designated for the External Data role. This file contains current request data. The user with the External Data role updates the data in the spreadsheet and emails the file to the External Data Email Account set up in Mass Maintenance. If the data in the spreadsheet passes validations, Mass Maintenance imports the data into the request automatically and continues processing the request.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Field Group</h3>
                    <p>Filter used to create a subset of data in a target field in Target Design and Map. Based on values in another related field, these subsets can have different settings, such as criticality, whether the field is required or which rules run against the field. For example, the ttMARA table in SAP stores general material data. The field MTART on that table stores the material type. Material types include FERT (Finished Goods), HALB (Semi Finished Goods) and ROH (Raw Materials). Field groups can be created based on material types, so that rules can be run on all Finished Goods, all Semi-Finished Goods, and so on.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Field Mapping</h3>
                    <p>Process of mapping fields from a source legacy system to a target system at the field level. Each field mapping has an action that determines; whether AutoGen builds a rule, the type of rule that AutoGen builds, the fields required to save the mapping on the Field Mappings page, and whether value mapping is necessary to map values in source fields to specific values in target fields.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Fixed Remediation Rule</h3>
                    <p>Rule used when only one value in a field in the target data requires remediation to quickly correct the data in that one field for all the records. Fixed remediation rules can correct instances where a required field in the target system has been left blank in the source data, or has been formatted incorrectly to be loaded into the target system.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Full Construction</h3>
                    <p>Source used as a single source or as one of multiple sources for a target in cases where no legacy data is available. Once the source is saved, AutoGen builds the Construct page (using the target’s active fields), the underlying table, and associated rules and stores them in the configured database. For example, a legacy application stores data about a material type, but does not support storing BOM or Routing data. If BOM or Routing data is required for the material type, a full construction source can be created to store it.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3 MadCap:conditions="Primary.ISA">Information Steward Accelerator (ISA)</h3>
                    <p MadCap:conditions="Primary.ISA">An application that extracts data that failed Information Steward (IS) rules, then distributes the data to groups of users. These user groups, called Project Distributions, can receive the data as an Excel file (.xlsx) attached to an email or can view a summary of the rule’s data.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Integrate</h3>
                    <p>A component of the Stewardship Tier that contains loading mechanisms to push data into an ERP system. Integrate loads data to SAP using Batch Data Communication (BDC) processing, Graphical User Interface (GUI) scripting, a Remote Function Call (RFC) or a BAPI. Integrate can also create and transfer user defined text files formatted as Delimited, Fixed Width, or XML to the SAP server.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Lookup Table</h3>
                    <p>Table that stores the target field and value used in value mapping. A legacy (source) field and value is converted to a value in the lookup table (also called a check table) that the target system accepts in the target table. For example, if two companies merge, the legacy org numbers can be converted and then value mapped to new org numbers (stored in an org number lookup table) in the target ERP system.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Looped Template</h3>
                    <p>Integrate template that uses a posting mechanism that processes multiple child keys for one parent key, allowing for multiple headers with multiple details to be posted. Looping is necessary when data in the same field at the detail level should be updated for multiple header records. For example, to enter data for the Export Legal Control for a Material, a template would need to generate one transaction with multiple screens to update the export control class for each country.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Map</h3>
                    <p>A tool that facilitates the process of mapping for a target system implementation. Map is a key component for capturing and tracking requirements, customer decisions and specifications to provide accurate mapping information.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Mapping Set</h3>
                    <p>Set of field mappings that can be exported and used as a back-up or imported and reused in another source in Map.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Metric Group</h3>
                    <p>Subcategory of a field group in Target Design to further organize data for metrics tracking and mapping progress. Each set of metric groups is delineated into logical sets of fields that relate to a screen within the target system. For SAP-related objects, the metric groups can represent the tabs within an SAP screen or TCode (e.g., Customer Basic, Sales, Company and Accounting).</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Opportunity View</h3>
                    <p>A view configured for the Data Quality report repository that contains the full set of possible records that could potentially fail in the associated error report Opportunity views are used for Data Quality Scoring.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Org Unit</h3>
                    <p>Used to manage data security by restricting data a user can access based on organizational structure. Org units such as plant or company code can be tied to one set of validations, one set of dependencies and configuration options. For example, a template to perform a material change can be segmented by plant. At the request level, the org unit values, or the specific plants, can be assigned so that only users who are assigned to those plants can view or add request data.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Page Event</h3>

                    <p>Type of table join that supports the automation of rules built for Update Row sources within mapping where rules are automatically created and registered in Transform. Add relationship joins between the Add Row and the Update Row source(s) where the source information and source criterion comes from a table other than the Add Row table being mapped. The join indicates how the table in the Add Row source is joined to the table in the Update Row source so the update rules can be created and registered in Transform. For example, if the Add Row source table is Product (e.g., the LEFT TABLE is stMARC_AW_Product), and the Update Row source table is ProductInventory (e.g., the RIGHT TABLE is stAW_ProductInventory), a join would be set up on the keys between the two tables, the ProductID field.</p>

                    <h3>Remediation Report</h3>
                    <p>Report generated after Transform has processed target data, and used as a basis to create remediation rules. These rules correct erroneous values to temporarily fix a data issue so the affected records can be loaded into a test environment.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Report Repository</h3>
                    <p>Reports in Data Quality  are organized by report repository. Once created in the database and registered in Common, report repositories must then be registered in Data Quality.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>S Field (boaStatus)</h3>
                    <p>Indicates the status of a record based on an assigned event. Validation Rules and Business Rules are assigned to events to verify conditions or take action on data based on a given condition. Actioned events run and can require certain actions from the user. Events can be run at the page level (affecting all records) or at the individual record level, for example, when a record is saved.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Security Definition</h3>
                    <p>Defines what data elements are used to limit access to records on a page displayed in the Stewardship Tier. A security definition must be defined to enable security for a component.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Security Key</h3>
                    <p>Key that represents values defined in the security definition to which users assigned to the role can access. For example, each wave-process area created in ADM is a security key that can be assigned to a role to allow users assigned to that role to access data for that context.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Security Role</h3>
                    <p>Role that is assigned to set of users that perform certain functions, such as Application Administrator. Security roles are associated with security definitions, which set access to pages and allowed actions (such as Edit) on those pages.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Service Page</h3>
                    <p>Non-interactive page that allows events to be configured and executed on a time-based Unit of Measure (UOM). Commonly used for automating a process to execute business logic against a specific record set, service pages could execute public WebApp events such as running Assemble packages or trimming log tables in a custom application.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Snap Shot Process</h3>
                    <p>A Map process that captures mapping statistics at a specific point in time to measure against Gate Wave metrics for field mapping and value mapping. A gate, with a gate date and a percentage complete, allows a user to evaluate current mapping status against a customizable goal.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>SQL AutoGen</h3>
                    <p>A component of ADM that creates basic objects used by the migration process (tables, rules and reports) so that users can focus on addressing complex requirements.</p>
                    <h3>Syniti Connect</h3>
                    <p>Syniti Connect uses the Stewardship Tier combined with Dell Boomi, an Integration Platform as a Service (IPaaS) solution. Boomi’s connectors allow the Stewardship Tier to extract and load data in systems that do not use a database connection, such as Workday, Salesforce or SAP SuccessFactors.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>System Type</h3>
                    <p>Generic information about external systems (e.g., Target ERP and Legacy) used for a data migration. Information captured for system types includes field names and description. A System Type flags key fields, and assigns check tables to field keys, join relationships between tables and generic mappings.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Tag</h3>
                    <p>Optional label applied to a task or group of tasks in dspTrack™. Tags can ensure that a group of tasks all have the same users, rules or validations, and can be used to group tasks for reporting purposes.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Target Design</h3>
                    <p>A component of ADM used to document tables, fields and sources used in the migration project. Targets can be imported from a database, system type, or Excel file. Target Design can also be used to configure rules for target fields and lookup tables for value mapping and to create field groups and metric groups to categorize and prioritize data as it is mapped.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Threshold</h3>
                    <p>Defines the status assigned to an object being scored when the percentage of defects falls below the threshold. Statuses are Red (critical), Yellow (warning) and Green and are displayed on summary pages, charts and dashboards Data Quality.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Transform</h3>
                    <p>A component of ADM that cleans, manipulates and reports on data, and exports the data so that it can be loaded into a target ERP system using a load tool.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Update Row Source</h3>
                    <p>Source used if data used in field mapping must originate from a source other than the Add Row source. For example, in the SAP target system, the Telephone2 field is on the same table (LFA1) as all the other address fields. A source system has a Supplier table that does not store the Telephone2 field. The field is stored on the Supplier Telephone table, which is an Update Row source, as it updates a field on the Supplier table.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Validation</h3>
                    <p>Stored procedures or views that execute when an event occurs and confirm that data is valid. If the validation fails, processing stops.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Value Mapping</h3>
                    <p>Process that allows an individual value in a source field to be configured and then converted to a value that the target system accepts in the target field. For example, if two companies merge, the legacy org numbers can be converted and then value mapped to new org numbers (stored in an org number lookup table) in the target ERP system.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>WebApp</h3>
                    <p>Application accessible in the Stewardship Tier. WebApps can be delivered applications or custom applications created in the Stewardship Tier framework.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>WebApp Group</h3>
                    <p>Defines authorization or access on a page by page basis. Page rights are configured by granting WebApp groups access to view, add, edit or delete data on the page.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Workflow</h3>
                    <p>Email notification method called from within a WebApp where an email is sent upon the execution of an event. If a workflow requires a user to log in to the Stewardship Tier to perform a function, a link can be included in the email to navigate directly to the relevant page in the WebApp. Workflow is used in situations where groups, users and fields outside the context of a particular page must complete a task, or when the decisions to manually send an email are complex.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>zLegacy Field</h3>
                    <p>As part of the Transform automation process, additional fields with a zLegacy prefix are created as required for the rules generation process. These include all primary key fields and all fields with an associated lookup table in Target Design. For example, if MATNR is a primary key on the material master target, the field zLegacyMATNR is automatically created on both the source and target tables and contains the legacy material number. In addition, if the field MEINS is assigned a lookup table of T006 in Target Design, the field zLegacyMEINS is also created on both the source table and target tables. It contains the legacy information required for cross referencing data via the lookup table.</p>
